# Novel Visualization

#### By Vanshika Sinha

In this project, a novel visualization was created using an interesting dataset. This project outlines a discussion about the novelty of the visualization and a critical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the visualization. 

## Dataset and Background

The dataset used for the visualization is taken from the College Scorecard database published by the ‘US Department of Education’. This College Scorecard provides data at the institution-level and data by field of study. The institute-level data is from 1996-97 to 2020-21 and the field of study-level data is from 2014-15 to 2018-19.

## Tools used

The ‘Tableau’ software has been used to visualize the data in various plots and combine the plots to generate a dashboard with multiple facets.

## Discussion about the novelty of the visualization

The data has been taken from the College Scorecard database published by the ‘US Department of Education’ and is available in raw format through APIs. The data has not been visualized in any manner from the source used. Hence, I have designed and created all charts in the visualization from scratch after the necessary pre-processing.
